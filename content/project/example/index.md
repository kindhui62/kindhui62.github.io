To address the challenge of unbalanced and insufficient high-quality teaching resources, this project develops a multi-modal, naturally interactive, virtual-real integration open teaching experimental environment to address the real-time simulation challenges associated with virtual-real integration. Additionally, the project dedicates itself to developing innovative models for teaching experiments. 

By leveraging the Unity engine, along with C# and Python technologies, I designed and developed a smart interactive pen and a virtual geometry teaching platform tailored for solid geometry experimental instruction. The system utilizes diverse technologies, including multimodal fusion, to establish an intent comprehension model for capturing user intentions and realizing active human-computer collaboration interaction. The system addresses issues related to unclear lectures and drawings in solid geometry teaching, providing enhanced technical support for geometry experimental instruction.
